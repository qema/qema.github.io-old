Title: Covers

I do covers of songs with voice, piano, violin and/or guitar. My tool is Logic Pro. Here's a sampling:

Viva la Vida (Coldplay): A dry woody string quartet combined with filtered vocals. OK, secret, the cellos are actually violins tuned down an octave. Don't tell the violas.

Under Cover of Darkness (The Strokes): Clockwork acoustics and raw vocals make this an indie extravaganza you don't want to miss.
