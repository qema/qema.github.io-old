Title: Odyssey

Odyssey is one of my previous online games, written in FreeBASIC.

A sci-fi MMORPG, it reached the closed beta stage and is one of my only projects to break into the third dimension. I implemented the 3D engine from scratch using 2D line drawing, inspired by a QBasic pseudo-3D racing game which achieved bigger than life perspective effects.

In terms of game mechanics, Odyssey is also an oddity, featuring a combat system based on opposing red and blue forces, with a neutral gray. The world was split in this way, with each faction receiving its own weapons and resources.
