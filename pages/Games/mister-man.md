Title: Mister Man

The Adventures of Mister Man is a platformer game I made in FreeBASIC. It features four exotic worlds that you can jump into and explore, including a boss! [Berry Hop](http://wanganzhou.com/archive/2015-10-23.html) is the successor to this game.

Mister Man is on a quest to defeat the evil Lava Monster and restore the balance of nature! Can you help him save the world?

Arrow keys to move, and use Shift + Arrow key to do a super jump which jumps twice as far.

## Story

Mister Man grew from a Christmas present for my twin friends Cary and Michael ([htwins.net](http://htwins.net)). For holidays and birthdays, we would make elaborate zany projects to share with each other, from Sodoku comic books to computer games. Some of these were precursors to some of our biggest projects, from [The Land of Stuff](http://wanganzhou.com/archive/2015-10-12.html) to [Battle for Dream Islan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL24C8378F296DB656).

Mister Man became an early exploration of:

- Elaborate game characters
- Vibing my musical compositions with game environments
- Custom map editors for character scripting
