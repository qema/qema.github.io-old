      The Hour it Strikes

  <section class="post-content">
    <p>Ah, fie, the mark is set.</p>
<p>Down, down, down. The bridge sweeps over the barren shore in the black night. One, two, three, the mark is set. Down, down, down we go into the dark night. Ah, fie, the mark is real. Down he says. To go down is the only way around, but the only way around is through. So through we go down into the depths of the dark. Where are the voices? These promises have no ends. Down, down inside and through, back and away. Voices, voices, where are the voices? Down, down, down.</p>
<p>No, says the wall. The decision is set. Fire eyes and yellow smiles can entreat the lost souls of yesterday but fools and followers are nevermore. Down, down, the promises have been kept. Never mind the decision. The promises have been kept.</p>
<p>Aye, we've come. The followers have met. To late and back again we entreat as the yellow sunset dances on the spines of the forgotten. Tisk, tisk, tisk, what goes on below. Where are the voices? Fie, the mark is set. Down, down, down.</p>
<p>What's elapsed has not yet passed. Cries, cries in the depths of the future echo back into the recesses of the past, a past that has come to haunt the rememberers and haunt the forgotten. Yes, yes we've cried under the stars in the black of the night when the cloud is a curtain over the bright red sunset of yesterday. To record this would be folly for the past burns bright red in our minds. Yes, we remember the cries. Yes, we remember the forgotten, but we forget the ones who forgot.</p>
<p>Yes, says the wall. My time has come. Yes, yes. Never mind the hollow and the obsequious. Fly above your insecure intent. I leave you with these words. Flower, foil, golden golden record. Farewell and may your walls tear down beside you. No, no, I lean on you. Yes, yes, my time has come. I am not ready. Tear down this folly of recollection. May sense be jumbled into your brainstream. Oh no, the hour has struck, the mark is set. Down, down, down.</p>
<p>Blink, a spark. Spirit is the enemy of nightmare. The meaningless stabs and punches, bites and bruises. The writhing stops when the hour is struck, but come the clock and the stabs they go on, stab stab stab into the night, red red red bleeds through the eyes into the mind into the skull, through is around but we go down, down, down into the depths of the dark. Where are the voices? No, says the wall. The only way through is down. To forget is to surrender. Red, red, red, red, red, red, red.</p>
<p>But what anguish supports your unknown? You misread me, I come with no intent. Yet you come to beseech. Fie, it has come again. Back, back into the recesses of desire. I come with no intent. I come with no intent. Backlash, retreat, it has become an anomaly, a rut, a wide arc.</p>
<p>I was seven when I was found, a heap of blankets in a long field of corn under a silent blue cloudless sky. That was when the remembering stopped and the fear began. Or when the fear began and the remembering stopped. Fear, it creeps and shivers, red red the sky is red and it bleeds.</p>
<p>Ah, the white walls and the bitterness of sterility. I've come for my donations. You will not bleed today. Am I not human? There is not enough of you. You will not bleed today. Is this a taunt? No, you would not remember the cries, the don't listen to the walls the walls they collapse and the spears from all sides no, no, no this is a taunt and the walls they will crumble. I am a human and I will bleed today, red, red, red, red, red, red, red.</p>
<p>Ah yes the time, I must be late. To hear the tick, tick and the one-two-three-four of the footsteps and to look onward, horizontal into the flatness of the horizon, drums marking the seconds with their clockwork pulse and there is no time to forget only to bury the forgotten into the folds of the footsteps and to march onwards flat into the plane of the horizon golden with the stretching expanse of corn and red, red with the setting sun, onwards into the night to the clockwork pulse of the drums, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, onwards, onwards, onwards, onwards, onwards, onwards and onwards into the night into the darkness of the forgotten. Yes, yes says the wall, my time has come.</p>

      Tie-Dye Algorithm
    </div>
  </header>
  <section class="post-content">
    <p><img alt="Tie-Dye" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/tie-dye2.png" /></p>
<p>There's some cool theory behind my rainbow tie-dye splashes. They're generated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm">Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm</a>, which is a really cool algorithm to connect the vertices of a graph, specifically creating a tree with shortest total edge length (or "weight"). It's used for anything from maze generation to circuit design.</p>
<p>Here's how the Tie Dye works.</p>
<p>We start out with the idea of turning our computer screen into a graph, with a vertex at every pixel.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph it!" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph-empty.png" /></p>
<p>We make a full grid connecting all vertices, assigning random weight to each edge.</p>
<p><img alt="Connect" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph-full.png" /></p>
<p>Next we use Prim's Algorithm to connect the edges in a tree. This gets rid of any loops in the graph. Now our computer tie dye will flow into new spaces instead of mixing with itself, just like water tension does for real tie dye.</p>
<p><img alt="Prim It!" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph0.png" /></p>
<p>Now, starting from a random point, we'll do a paint bucket fill on it (specifically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">Depth First Search</a>). Except, ours will be a special rainbow paint bucket that changes color after each step, and can only flow along the edges.</p>
<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph1.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph2.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph3.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph4.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph5.png" /></p>
<p>Now we have a rainbow tie-dye pattern!</p>
<p>You can make your own Prim Tie-Dyes. I have my tie-dye program on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/qema/tie-dye">Tie-Dye</a>. It's written in Swift and Cocoa. It uses a slightly different implementation where the painting and the Prim are interlaced. Check it out and share your tie-dye creations with the world!</p>

<p>Ahem. Deep narrator voice.</p>
<p>Allow me to introduce to you the new Music section. You'll find that music and computer science have mysterious links. Both are fractally organized, with deep layers of abstraction, ascending from the concrete into the realm of pure form. Both have a profound symmetry that stems from their mathematical roots. But unlike math, which is frozen in time, these two arts dance to life, are founded on the temporal: the execution of an algorithm, the performance of a piece. They dance between order and chaos, one to generate insight and meaning, one to charm and captivate. For these arts, reductionism is the key to mastery -- crumbling apart a program into its component functions, or a musical score into individual notes on a staff. But lifting through the clay into the clarity of abstraction we find purity, elegance.</p>
<p>I'll update regularly with my musical explorations.</p>

      Berry Hop
    </div>
  </header>
  <section class="post-content">
    <p>Berry Hop is my current iPhone game project, coded in Swift.</p>
<p><img alt="Berry Hop" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/berry/berry.png" /></p>
<p>My goal is to combine exciting platformer gameplay with the depth of story, puzzle-solving and deep decision making elements common to role-playing games. I'm inspired by games like Hasbro's 3D <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubo6afKReBk">Frogger</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>. On the technical side, this involves a deep entity scripting system, map editor and component-based architecture.</p>
<p><img alt="Map Editor" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/berry/mapeditor.png" /></p>
<p>Play as Berry as you head through forests and mountains, treacherous ice and steaming hot lava, solving mind bending puzzles and dodging enemies in a quest to save the Berry kingdom. These treks are designed to fit in small pockets of time, which is where the platformer aspect shines. It's a great launchpad for mobile storytelling.</p>
<p>Check out this demo on YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/F_fUK3vFJGY">Berry Hop</a>.</p>
<p>I'm working on music for Berry Hop which goes along with the sense of diverse environments.<br />
Here's the Berry Forest theme:<br />
