<p>Ahem. Deep narrator voice.</p>
<p>Allow me to introduce to you the new Music section. You'll find that music and computer science have mysterious links. Both are fractally organized, with deep layers of abstraction, ascending from the concrete into the realm of pure form. Both have a profound symmetry that stems from their mathematical roots. But unlike math, which is frozen in time, these two arts dance to life, are founded on the temporal: the execution of an algorithm, the performance of a piece. They dance between order and chaos, one to generate insight and meaning, one to charm and captivate. For these arts, reductionism is the key to mastery -- crumbling apart a program into its component functions, or a musical score into individual notes on a staff. But lifting through the clay into the clarity of abstraction we find purity, elegance.</p>
<p>I'll update regularly with my musical explorations.</p>

      Berry Hop

  <section class="post-content">
    <p>Berry Hop is my current iPhone game project, coded in Swift.</p>
<p><img alt="Berry Hop" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/berry/berry.png" /></p>
<p>My goal is to combine exciting platformer gameplay with the depth of story, puzzle-solving and deep decision making elements common to role-playing games. I'm inspired by games like Hasbro's 3D <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubo6afKReBk">Frogger</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>. On the technical side, this involves a deep entity scripting system, map editor and component-based architecture.</p>
<p><img alt="Map Editor" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/berry/mapeditor.png" /></p>
<p>Play as Berry as you head through forests and mountains, treacherous ice and steaming hot lava, solving mind bending puzzles and dodging enemies in a quest to save the Berry kingdom. These treks are designed to fit in small pockets of time, which is where the platformer aspect shines. It's a great launchpad for mobile storytelling.</p>
<p>Check out this demo on YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/F_fUK3vFJGY">Berry Hop</a>.</p>
<p>I'm working on music for Berry Hop which goes along with the sense of diverse environments.<br />
Here's the Berry Forest theme:<br />

<p>Today's spotlight is on Author, which is an exploration in simple text classification. It figures out an author's unique "word signature", which is the distribution of word frequencies in their writing. Based on this, it can take any piece of writing and figure out who wrote it!</p>
<p>You can check it out on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/qema/author">Author</a>.</p>
<p>Makes use of cool probability tools like <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/">Bayes' Theorem</a>!</p>
<p>How it works: we want to find out "What is the probability that author A wrote book X, if we know that X has a certain word composition?" It turns out that we can use Bayes' Theorem to flip this around, into "What is the probability that X has a certain word composition, if we know that author A wrote the book?" Well, since we know the authors' "word signatures", we already know how to do that -- all we have to do is tally up words! It seems like Bayes' Theorem has the power to reverse causation! What will you do with your new superpower?</p>

      Sound Transfer
    </div>
  </header>
  <section class="post-content">
    <p>Here's my next project spotlight.</p>
<p><img alt="Sound Transfer" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/sound-transfer/screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>Sound Transfer is a system to send a message from your computer to a friend's with speaker and mic. It uses a melodic pitch-based protocol, which means you can hear your message converted into a musical ditty in the process!</p>
<p>Check out the source code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/losmmorpg/sound-transfer">Sound Transfer</a>.</p>
<p>Method: The outgoing message is converted into its binary ASCII representation, then converted to pitches with the melodic protocol. The receiver picks up the pitches with Fourier transforms and decodes from binary to ASCII text.</p>
<p>Here's the protocol.</p>
<pre><code>Pitch   Symbol  Meaning
---------------------------------------
1976 Hz  '!'    Begin transmission.
1174 Hz  '0'    Send a binary 0.
784 Hz   '1'    Send a binary 1.
988 Hz   '*'    Used as a separator between repeated digits.
1568 Hz  '.'    End transmission.
</code></pre>
<p>Wow! So musical!<br />
Create your own message melodies.</p>
<p>Like with The Land of Stuff, I'm adding a mini-page for Sound Transfer <a href="http://wanganzhou.com/sound-transfer.html">here</a>, which you can get to anytime using the bar at the top of this website.</p>
<p>Coming up: Author text classifier.</p>
