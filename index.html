    <p>Berry Hop is my current iPhone game project, coded in Swift.</p>
<p><img alt="Berry Hop" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/berry/berry.png" /></p>
<p>My goal is to combine exciting platformer gameplay with the depth of story, puzzle-solving and deep decision making elements common to role-playing games. I'm inspired by games like Hasbro's 3D <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubo6afKReBk">Frogger</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>. On the technical side, this involves a deep entity scripting system, map editor and component-based architecture.</p>
<p><img alt="Map Editor" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/berry/mapeditor.png" /></p>
<p>Play as Berry as you head through forests and mountains, treacherous ice and steaming hot lava, solving mind bending puzzles and dodging enemies in a quest to save the Berry kingdom. These treks are designed to fit in small pockets of time, which is where the platformer aspect shines. It's a great launchpad for mobile storytelling.</p>
<p>Check out this demo on YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/F_fUK3vFJGY">Berry Hop</a>.</p>
<p>I'm working on music for Berry Hop which goes along with the sense of diverse environments.<br />
Here's Berry's Theme:

<p>I'm also giving Berry Hop its own page which you can get to <a href="http://wanganzhou.com/berry-hop.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Today's spotlight is on Author, which is an exploration in simple text classification. It figures out an author's unique "word signature", which is the distribution of word frequencies in their writing. Based on this, it can take any piece of writing and figure out who wrote it!</p>
<p>You can check it out on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/qema/author">Author</a>.</p>
<p>Makes use of cool probability tools like <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/">Bayes' Theorem</a>!</p>
<p>How it works: we want to find out "What is the probability that author A wrote book X, if we know that X has a certain word composition?" It turns out that we can use Bayes' Theorem to flip this around, into "What is the probability that X has a certain word composition, if we know that author A wrote the book?" Well, since we know the authors' "word signatures", we already know how to do that -- all we have to do is tally up words! It seems like Bayes' Theorem has the power to reverse causation! What will you do with your new superpower?</p>

      Sound Transfer
    </div>
  </header>
  <section class="post-content">
    <p>Here's my next project spotlight.</p>
<p><img alt="Sound Transfer" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/sound-transfer/screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>Sound Transfer is a system to send a message from your computer to a friend's with speaker and mic. It uses a melodic pitch-based protocol, which means you can hear your message converted into a musical ditty in the process!</p>
<p>Check out the source code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/losmmorpg/sound-transfer">Sound Transfer</a>.</p>
<p>Method: The outgoing message is converted into its binary ASCII representation, then converted to pitches with the melodic protocol. The receiver picks up the pitches with Fourier transforms and decodes from binary to ASCII text.</p>
<p>Here's the protocol.</p>
<pre><code>Pitch   Symbol  Meaning
---------------------------------------
1976 Hz  '!'    Begin transmission.
1174 Hz  '0'    Send a binary 0.
784 Hz   '1'    Send a binary 1.
988 Hz   '*'    Used as a separator between repeated digits.
1568 Hz  '.'    End transmission.
</code></pre>
<p>Wow! So musical!<br />
Create your own message melodies.</p>
<p>Like with The Land of Stuff, I'm adding a mini-page for Sound Transfer <a href="http://wanganzhou.com/sound-transfer.html">here</a>, which you can get to anytime using the bar at the top of this website.</p>
<p>Coming up: Author text classifier.</p>

      The Land of Stuff
    </div>
  </header>
  <section class="post-content">
    <p>Here's my first project spotlight. The Land of Stuff is an online role playing game coded in <a href="http://freebasic.net">FreeBASIC</a>. It's about exploring a huge world with friends -- fighting monsters, trading loot, going on quests and battling other players. The server was online from 2009 to 2010.</p>
<p>I'm releasing it here in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>You download the full game as-is, <a href="http://wanganzhou.com/downloads/land-of-stuff.zip">here</a>. (Requires Windows)</li>
<li>I'm also releasing the source code on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/losmmorpg/land-of-stuff">here</a>. You can customize the game or create your own adventure world.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The Land of Stuff" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/los/people.png" /></p>
<p>The Land of Stuff is based on a simple C++ text adventure I made called The Adventures of Carl.</p>
<p><img alt="The Adventures of Carl" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/los/carl.png" /></p>
<p>What carried over was the idea of simple mechanics and a focus on exploration.
Here's the world map of The Land of Stuff:</p>
<p><img src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/los/map.png" alt="World Map" style="width: 640px;"/></p>
<p>Here's the Fid City Zoo:</p>
<p><img alt="Fid City Zoo" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/los/screen15.png" /></p>
<p>It also features an extensive (though rudimentary) scripting system for relatively involved quests and NPC (non-player character) interactions. For example, here's a snippet of the Ant Terminator quest:
<pre><code class="nohighlight">
AntTerminator:
  SLAY 05 00
  IF_AC1
    SPEECH Are you done yet?
    REPLY Yep!
    SPEECH Thank you! Here's 50 dollars.
    REPLY Yay!
    MONEY 50
    MSG You've beat Ant Terminator!
    AC0
    GOTO Finished
  END_IF
</code></pre>
It's powerful enough that you can make quests with interesting stories. Yes, there are GOTOs.</p>
<p>You can check out The Land of Stuff on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC03806BA687F460A">Land of Stuff</a>.</p>
<p>I'm also including a page for the game with info and game guide <a href="http://wanganzhou.com/land-of-stuff.html">here</a>, which you can also get to from the top bar of this website. Happy adventuring!</p>

    <p>Hi. I'm Andrew. I'm in CS at Cornell. I think in computer science and philosophy. I pass the Turing test most of the time. I'm excited to share with you my adventures in artificial intelligence, games and computer music.</p>
<p>So I'm starting this new blog format. To start off, on Mondays and Fridays, I'll spotlight one of my previous projects. Here's a preview:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Land of Stuff: online role-playing game.</li>
<li>Sound Transfer: transfer data between computers with microphone and speaker.</li>
<li>Author: a text classifier that figures out who wrote an essay or book.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is made using my own static site generator, <a href="https://github.com/losmmorpg/nanosite">nanosite</a>. The vision is for making website content to be as intuitive and beautiful as possible, through simple tools and workflow. Right now it is a baby.</p>
<p>Also, here's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">QuickSort</a> in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>!</p>
<pre><code>let rec sort = function
| [] -&gt; []
| h::t -&gt; let pivot = h in
          let (left, right) = List.partition ((&gt;) pivot) t in
          (sort left) @ [pivot] @ (sort right)
</code></pre>
<p>Stay tuned for more.</p>
