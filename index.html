    <p>I used Python, <a href="http://visjs.org">vis.js</a> and the <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu">MIT Shakespare collection</a> to visualize dialogue networks in Shakespeare plays.</p>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>Each vertex represents a character, and the edges connect characters who talk with each other. I did this by taking all the sets of characters on stage between each stage direction, and then merging these sets. This turns out to be a good heuristic because it breaks groups between character entrances and exits, and other stage directions simply cause redundant groups to form which get filtered during merging.</p>
<p>The edges are modeled as physical springs with vis.js so clusters tend to form based on the emergent "cliques". Finally, the characters are colored in the graph by popularity.</p>
<p>I'm also posting an interactive version as a page here: <a href="http://wanganzhou.com/shakespeare.html">Dialogue Graphs</a></p>
<p>Here are the dialogue graphs!</p>

      Tie-Dye Algorithm
    </div>
  </header>
  <section class="post-content">
    <p><img alt="Tie-Dye" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/tie-dye2.png" /></p>
<p>There's some cool theory behind my rainbow tie-dye splashes. They're generated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm">Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm</a>, which is a really cool algorithm to connect the vertices of a graph, specifically creating a tree with shortest total edge length (or "weight"). It's used for anything from maze generation to circuit design.</p>
<p>Here's how the Tie Dye works.</p>
<p>We start out with the idea of turning our computer screen into a graph, with a vertex at every pixel.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph it!" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph-empty.png" /></p>
<p>We make a full grid connecting all vertices, assigning random weight to each edge.</p>
<p><img alt="Connect" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph-full.png" /></p>
<p>Next we use Prim's Algorithm to connect the edges in a tree. This gets rid of any loops in the graph. Now our computer tie dye will flow into new spaces instead of mixing with itself, just like water tension does for real tie dye.</p>
<p><img alt="Prim It!" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph0.png" /></p>
<p>Now, starting from a random point, we'll do a paint bucket fill on it (specifically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">Depth First Search</a>). Except, ours will be a special rainbow paint bucket that changes color after each step, and can only flow along the edges.</p>
<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph1.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph2.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph3.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph4.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph5.png" /></p>
<p>Now we have a rainbow tie-dye pattern!</p>
<p>You can make your own Prim Tie-Dyes. I have my tie-dye program on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/qema/tie-dye">Tie-Dye</a>. It's written in Swift and Cocoa. It uses a slightly different implementation where the painting and the Prim are interlaced. Check it out and share your tie-dye creations with the world!</p>

<p>Ahem. Deep narrator voice.</p>
<p>Allow me to introduce to you the new Music section. You'll find that music and computer science have mysterious links. Both are fractally organized, with deep layers of abstraction, ascending from the concrete into the realm of pure form. Both have a profound symmetry that stems from their mathematical roots. But unlike math, which is frozen in time, these two arts dance to life, are founded on the temporal: the execution of an algorithm, the performance of a piece. They dance between order and chaos, one to generate insight and meaning, one to charm and captivate. For these arts, reductionism is the key to mastery -- crumbling apart a program into its component functions, or a musical score into individual notes on a staff. But lifting through the clay into the clarity of abstraction we find purity, elegance.</p>
<p>I'll update regularly with my musical explorations.</p>

      Berry Hop
    </div>
  </header>
  <section class="post-content">
    <p>Berry Hop is my current iPhone game project, coded in Swift.</p>
<p><img alt="Berry Hop" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/berry/berry.png" /></p>
<p>My goal is to combine exciting platformer gameplay with the depth of story, puzzle-solving and deep decision making elements common to role-playing games. I'm inspired by games like Hasbro's 3D <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubo6afKReBk">Frogger</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>. On the technical side, this involves a deep entity scripting system, map editor and component-based architecture.</p>
<p><img alt="Map Editor" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/berry/mapeditor.png" /></p>
<p>Play as Berry as you head through forests and mountains, treacherous ice and steaming hot lava, solving mind bending puzzles and dodging enemies in a quest to save the Berry kingdom. These treks are designed to fit in small pockets of time, which is where the platformer aspect shines. It's a great launchpad for mobile storytelling.</p>
<p>Check out this demo on YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/F_fUK3vFJGY">Berry Hop</a>.</p>
<p>I'm working on music for Berry Hop which goes along with the sense of diverse environments.<br />
Here's the Berry Forest theme:<br />
