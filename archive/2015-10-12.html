    <p>Here's my first project spotlight. The Land of Stuff is an online role playing game coded in <a href="http://freebasic.net">FreeBASIC</a>. It's about exploring a huge world with friends -- fighting monsters, trading loot, going on quests and battling other players. The server was online from 2009 to 2010.</p>
<p>I'm releasing it here in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>You download the full game as-is, <a href="http://wanganzhou.com/downloads/land-of-stuff.zip">here</a>. (Requires Windows)</li>
<li>I'm also releasing the source code on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/losmmorpg/land-of-stuff">here</a>. You can customize the game or create your own adventure world.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Land of Stuff is based on a simple C++ text adventure I made called The Adventures of Carl.</p>

<p>What carried over was the idea of simple mechanics and a focus on exploration.
Here's the world map of The Land of Stuff:</p>

<p>Here's the Fid City Zoo:</p>

<p>It also features an extensive (though rudimentary) scripting system for relatively involved quests and NPC (non-player character) interactions. For example, here's a snippet of the Ant Terminator quest:
<pre><code class="nohighlight">
AntTerminator:
  SLAY 05 00
  IF_AC1
    SPEECH Are you done yet?
    REPLY Yep!
    SPEECH Thank you! Here's 50 dollars.
    REPLY Yay!
    MONEY 50
    MSG You've beat Ant Terminator!
    AC0
    GOTO Finished
  END_IF
</code></pre>
It's powerful enough that you can make quests with interesting stories. Yes, there are GOTOs.</p>
<p>You can check out The Land of Stuff on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC03806BA687F460A">Land of Stuff</a>.</p>
<p>I'm also including a page for the game with info and game guide <a href="http://wanganzhou.com/land-of-stuff.html">here</a>, which you can also get to from the top bar of this website. Happy adventuring!</p>
