Title: The Land of Stuff

Here's my first project spotlight. The Land of Stuff is an online role playing game coded in [FreeBASIC](http://freebasic.net). It's about exploring a huge world with friends -- fighting monsters, trading loot, going on quests and battling other players. The server was online from 2009 to 2010.

I'm releasing it here in two ways.

* You download the full game as-is, [here](http://wanganzhou.com/downloads/land-of-stuff.zip).
* I'm also releasing the source code on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/losmmorpg/land-of-stuff). You can customize the game or create your own adventure world.

The Land of Stuff is based on a simple C++ text adventure I made called The Adventures of Carl.

What carried over was the idea of simple mechanics and a focus on exploration.
Here's the world map of The Land of Stuff:
