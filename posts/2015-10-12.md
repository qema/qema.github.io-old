Title: The Land of Stuff

Here's my first project spotlight. The Land of Stuff is an online role playing game coded in [FreeBASIC](http://freebasic.net). It's about exploring a huge world with friends -- fighting monsters, trading loot, going on quests and battling other players. The server was online from 2009 to 2010.

I'm releasing it here in two ways.

* You download the full game as-is, [here](http://wanganzhou.com/downloads/land-of-stuff.zip). (Requires Windows)
* I'm also releasing the source code on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/losmmorpg/land-of-stuff). You can customize the game or create your own adventure world.

The Land of Stuff is based on a simple C++ text adventure I made called The Adventures of Carl.

What carried over was the idea of simple mechanics and a focus on exploration.
Here's the world map of The Land of Stuff:

Here's the Fid City Zoo:

It also features an extensive (though rudimentary) scripting system for relatively involved quests and NPC (non-player character) interactions. For example, here's a snippet of the Ant Terminator quest:
<pre><code class="nohighlight">
AntTerminator:
  SLAY 05 00
  IF_AC1
    SPEECH Are you done yet?
    REPLY Yep!
    SPEECH Thank you! Here's 50 dollars.
    REPLY Yay!
    MONEY 50
    MSG You've beat Ant Terminator!
    AC0
    GOTO Finished
  END_IF
</code></pre>
It's powerful enough that you can make quests with interesting stories. Yes, there are GOTOs.

I'm also including a page for the game with info and game guide [here](http://wanganzhou.com/land-of-stuff.html), which you can also get to from the top bar of this website. Happy adventuring!
