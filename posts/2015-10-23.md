Title: Berry Hop

Berry Hop is my current iPhone game project, coded in Swift.

My goal is to combine exciting platformer gameplay with the depth of story, puzzle-solving and deep decision making elements common to role-playing games. I'm inspired by games like Hasbro's 3D [Frogger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubo6afKReBk) and [Super Mario Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy). On the technical side, this involves a deep entity scripting system, map editor and component-based architecture.

Play as Berry as you head through forests and mountains, treacherous ice and steaming hot lava, solving mind bending puzzles and dodging enemies in a quest to save the Berry kingdom. These treks are designed to fit in small pockets of time, which is where the platformer aspect shines. It's a great launchpad for mobile storytelling.

I'm working on music for Berry Hop which goes along with the sense of diverse environments.  
Here's the Berry Forest theme:
