Title: Berry Hop

Berry Hop is my current iPhone game project, coded in Swift.

My goal is to combine exciting platformer gameplay with the depth of story, puzzle-solving and deep decision making elements common to role-playing games. I'm inspired by games like Hasbro's 3D [Frogger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubo6afKReBk) and [Super Mario Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy). On the technical side, this involves a deep entity scripting system, map editor and component-based architecture.
