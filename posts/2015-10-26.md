Ahem. Deep narrator voice.

Allow me to introduce to you the new Music section. You'll find that music and computer science have mysterious links. Both are fractally organized, with deep layers of abstraction, ascending from the concrete into the realm of pure form. Both have a profound symmetry that stems from their mathematical roots. But unlike math, which is frozen in time, these two arts dance to life, are founded on the temporal: the execution of an algorithm, the performance of a piece. They dance between order and chaos, one to generate insight and meaning, one to charm and captivate. For these arts, reductionism is the key to mastery -- crumbling apart a program into its component functions, or a musical score into individual notes on a staff. But lifting through the clay into the clarity of abstraction we find purity, elegance.

I'll update regularly with my musical explorations.
