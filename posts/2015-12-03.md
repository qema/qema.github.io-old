Title: Shakespeare Social Networks

I used Python, [vis.js](http://visjs.org) and the [MIT Shakespeare collection](http://shakespeare.mit.edu) to visualize dialogue networks in Shakespeare plays.

## Method

Each vertex represents a character, and the edges connect characters who talk with each other. I did this by taking all the sets of characters on stage between each stage direction, and then merging these sets. This turns out to be a good heuristic because it breaks groups between character entrances and exits, and other stage directions simply cause redundant groups to form which get filtered during merging.

The edges are modeled as physical springs with vis.js so clusters tend to form based on the emergent "cliques". Finally, the characters are colored in the graph by popularity.

I'm also posting an interactive version as a page here: [Dialogue Graphs](http://wanganzhou.com/shakespeare.html)

Here are the dialogue graphs!
