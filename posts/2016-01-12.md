Title: Odyssey

Odyssey is another game from the FreeBASIC era, which I planned to be the successor to [The Land of Stuff](http://wanganzhou.com/land-of-stuff.html). Eventually I integrated its improved server into the Land of Stuff for its rehaul.

A sci-fi MMORPG, it reached the closed beta stage and is one of my only projects to break into the third dimension. I implemented the 3D engine from scratch using 2D line drawing, inspired by a QBasic pseudo-3D racing game which achieved bigger than life perspective effects.

## Red versus Blue

In terms of game mechanics, Odyssey is also an oddity, featuring a combat system based on opposing red and blue forces, with a neutral gray. The world was split in this way, with each faction receiving its own weapons and resources.

## Toolbox

Finally it was another step towards extensive tooling in my projects, from an EXP curve planner to a rule-breaker logger. Here's the EXP grapher:

## But Some Things Stay the Same

Like most of my games it also featured multiple planet environments to launch to and explore. Adventure is everywhere.
