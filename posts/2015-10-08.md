Title: Hello World!

Hi. I'm Andrew. I'm in CS at Cornell. I think in computer science and philosophy. I pass the Turing test most of the time. I'm excited to share with you my adventures in artificial intelligence, games and computer music.

So I'm starting this new blog format. To start off, on Mondays and Fridays, I'll spotlight one of my previous projects. Here's a preview:

* The Land of Stuff: online role-playing game.
* Sound Transfer: transfer data between computers with microphone and speaker.
* Author: a text classifier that figures out who wrote an essay or book.

This site is made using my own static site generator, [nanosite](https://github.com/losmmorpg/nanosite). The vision is for making website content to be as intuitive and beautiful as possible, through simple tools and workflow. Right now it is a baby.

Also, here's [QuickSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)!

    let rec sort = function
    | [] -> []
    | h::t -> let pivot = h in
              let (left, right) = List.partition ((>) pivot) t in
              (sort left) @ [pivot] @ (sort right)

Stay tuned for more.
